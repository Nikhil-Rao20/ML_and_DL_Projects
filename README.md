# ML_and_DL_Projects
In this repository I will be sharing all the projects, that I have created, in the field of Machine Learning and Deep Learning

# Project 1: Recommendation System
This projects demonstrates basic recommendation system used for movie streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime and many more. I have used content based filtering technique in this recommendation system. This project is developed in to a Streamlit application, where the user can easily access the features of this project. This project was intresting, exciting and very much fun to do.

# Project 2: Sign Language Detection
This project is a video based sign language detection using the mediapipe library and a complex RandomForest Classifier Algorithm, to classify the classes of the hand signs. We have trained the model for the letter "A" to "Z" (excluding "J" and "Z"). We have a got the average inference time as 120 milliseconds, which is in better performance category. Open source contribution and Upgradations are welcomed!

# Project 3: Hand Sign Detection- Image based
This is the base version of Sign Language Detection Project. This project includes a image based hand sign classification project. This is done on MNIST Hand Signs Dataset. It is very useful step before the actual video based one.

# Project 4: Live Car Counter
This project helps near the toll gates, by counting the vehicles. This project is developed using the YOLO-V8n and YOLO-V8l versions. We got varying results for these 2 models, as usually we got better results for the heavy model YOLO-V8l version. This project includes of bounding box the vehicles, recognition as car,bus,motorbike and truck, determing the confidence, tracking the vehicle, minimizing the focusing the area of the input footage and finally calculating the total vehicle count in live. A wonderful project under the Computer Vision Domain.
